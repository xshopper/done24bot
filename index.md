# Download 
the app from [the latest release](https://github.com/xshopper/done24bot/releases/latest){:target="_blank"} (exe for windows, dmg for mac)

# Use it!
1. Register and log in to the application.
2. Start the application and wait a bit. At the first start it will download the chrome for execution
3. Search for an execution plan like this: Instagram - likes by hashtag.
4. Click on the play button and select the "demo" parameter, click on the play button next to the parameter.
If it does not work on a first place please restart the app, wait a minute and try again.

The script will ask you to log in to instagram and once you logged in it will like the latest posts under the #instagram hashtag.

# FAQ
* Is it working in mobile? -> Not yet, as soon as the desktop application became stable we will work on the mobile version
* Can I have a new script? yes! please email your requirement to hello@done24bot.com
* Is it safe? -> We try to make it safe as possible, have checks in the script ... etc. Do not run and create 1000s of likes in a day, IG will ban you!
* Do you save any passwords? -> No, we do not save the passwords from the website.
* How much is this? -> $20 USD per month with unlimited run (it is free for now until the payment option developed)
* Can I be on Instagram on my phone while it is running on desktop? -> Yes you can. It is like another session used by someone else.
